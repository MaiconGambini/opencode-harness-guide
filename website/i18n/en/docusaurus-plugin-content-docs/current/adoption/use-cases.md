# Use Cases

Choose the workflow by risk, dependencies, and duration, not only by file
count. Gates measure only metrics declared in
`agent-os/quality-thresholds.json#metrics`; a missing signal is a gap, not an
approval.

| Scenario | Recommended selection |
|---|---|
| Simple one-file task | One short lane, WIP=1 |
| Small bug fix | Reproduction, minimal fix, regression |
| Complex feature | Spec, contract, ownership lanes |
| Independent multitask | Parallel lanes with disjoint ownership |
| Dependent multitask | Lanes serialized by dependencies |
| Multi-session | Durable state and handoff |
| High-risk or security | Full tier and specialist review |
| Docs-only | Docs lane and source/link validation |
| Refine and learned rule | Judge, Refine, separate confirmation |

## Simple one-file task

**When to use:** a localized change with a clear requirement and no new
dependency, migration, or high-risk-path effect.

**Example prompt:**

```text
/prevc Fix the empty copy in src/components/EmptyState.tsx. Change only that
file and run the area test and local gate.
```

**Expected behavior:** PREVC creates one WIP=1 unit, confirms scope, and runs
the discovered verification and local gate. The scheduler escalates review
only when the risk router or a gap requires it. v1.3 creates no Refine work
without a recurring typed finding.

**Common mistakes:** opening a large spec; touching adjacent files; calling a
green gate proof when relevant metrics are unavailable.

## Small bug fix

**When to use:** reproducible behavior with a likely bounded cause and an
automatable regression.

**Example prompt:**

```text
/prevc Reproduce the duplicate pagination error, add a regression test, make
the smallest fix, and validate the affected route.
```

**Expected behavior:** Plan records reproduction and acceptance criteria;
Execute follows red-green; Validate runs regression and gates; Judge compares
the fix with the original bug. A rule breach returns as a typed finding with a
resolvable pointer.

**Common mistakes:** fixing before reproducing; widening the refactor;
recording a preference as `rule_violation` without citing a real rule.

## Complex feature

**When to use:** multiple components, design decisions, schema changes,
integrations, or independent acceptance criteria.

**Example prompt:**

```text
/prevc Design and implement report exports. Specify contracts, separate API,
worker, and UI ownership, and request approval before execution.
```

**Expected behavior:** PREVC produces a spec and evaluation contract, maps risk
and ownership, divides the plan into bounded lanes, and keeps one active goal.
The scheduler runs the full gate, the risk router selects review depth, and
Judge consumes aggregated evidence.

**Common mistakes:** coding before approval; sharing files across lanes; using
test volume as a substitute for acceptance criteria.

## Independent multitask parallel lanes

**When to use:** two or more tasks have no dependency and have disjoint file
sets.

**Example prompt:**

```text
/prevc Run the parser fix and status component update in parallel. Declare
exclusive ownership and return evidence per lane.
```

**Expected behavior:** the scheduler builds the manifest before dispatch,
injects only active rules matching each ownership set, and runs lanes in
parallel. Each lane runs its local gate; the scheduler is the sole findings
file writer and runs the aggregate gate.

**Common mistakes:** parallelizing tasks that edit the same file; allowing
reviewers to write findings; merging results without lane and capability data.

## Dependent multitask serialized lanes

**When to use:** one task produces a contract, schema, or artifact consumed by
the next.

**Example prompt:**

```text
/prevc Stabilize the API contract first, update the client second, and adapt
the UI last. Do not start a lane before the prior lane returns evidence.
```

**Expected behavior:** PREVC represents blocking edges and runs only the
released lane. Each boundary validates its artifact before the next dispatch;
aggregate gates and Judge run when the chain ends.

**Common mistakes:** calling dependencies parallel; starting consumers against
a provisional contract; hiding a blocker to keep execution moving.

## Multi-session work

**When to use:** the goal does not fit one session or must survive pauses,
agent changes, or later review.

**Example prompt:**

```text
/prevc Continue the active goal using STATE.md and session-handoff.md. Confirm
the latest valid gate before resuming the next WIP=1 unit.
```

**Expected behavior:** goal, state, findings, ledger, and handoff persist in the
repository. The new session rereads context and checks whether evidence is
still valid; stale or missing reports fail closed.

**Common mistakes:** relying on chat history; marking `passing` without output;
reusing a report after its source changed.

## High-risk or security work

**When to use:** authentication, credentials, payments, permissions,
migrations, infrastructure, or paths matching `high_risk_paths`.

**Example prompt:**

```text
/prevc Fix session validation. Classify it as high risk, limit scope to auth,
include abuse tests, and require full security review.
```

**Expected behavior:** the risk router selects full review; unavailable metrics
prevent downgrade; specialist reviewers return typed findings. A Refine
proposal with a high-risk effect preserves operator confirmation before it can
become a rule.

**Common mistakes:** treating permissions as a sandbox; lowering the tier
because unit tests passed; placing a secret in evidence or a finding.

## Docs-only work

**When to use:** content, navigation, or examples with no runtime change.

**Example prompt:**

```text
/prevc Update the bilingual installation guide, validate links and build, do
not change runtime or declare governing numbers in prose.
```

**Expected behavior:** PREVC keeps ownership within docs, runs source, link,
and build validation, and records gaps. Governing numbers remain in
`quality-thresholds.json` keys, not documentation.

**Common mistakes:** skipping the build because it is docs-only; duplicating
config values in prose; claiming a configured capability has live acceptance.

## Refine and learned-rule cycle

**When to use:** typed findings show a recurring failure and Judge has already
finished. Use `/refine --note` when the operator wants to record a manual fix
as evidence.

**Example prompt:**

```text
/refine
```

**Expected behavior:** Refine reads the gate-bound window and ledger, proposes
at most one improvement per component, and writes nothing. Literal proposal
text appears at `awaiting_confirmation`; rules that can block require operator
approval and land as a separate change. Active rules are injected into matching
lanes on the next run.

**Common mistakes:** treating a proposal as approval; letting the refiner edit
the ledger; giving Refine a Judge vote; claiming auto-activation. It ships off
at `learned_rules.auto_activate_prose_observe` until live acceptance and a
restart.
